      question: "How do I measure ROI from AI initiatives?",
      answer: "Track metrics like cycle time reduction, error rate improvements, cost savings, and productivity gains. We help establish baseline measurements before implementation and track improvements throughout deployment."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the typical timeline to see results?",
      answer: "Pilot projects often show measurable results within 2-6 weeks. Full production deployments deliver sustained value within 3-6 months, with continuous improvement over time."
    },
    {
      question: "How does AI fit with our existing processes?",
      answer: "AI augments rather than replaces existing workflows. We identify high-value use cases, integrate with current systems, and ensure minimal disruption while maximizing impact."
    },
    {
      question: "What if our team lacks AI expertise?",
      answer: "That's exactly why we exist. We bring the AI expertise, implement the solutions, train your team, and provide documentation. You focus on your business, we handle the AI complexity."
