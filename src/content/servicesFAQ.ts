    question: "How long does implementation take?",
    answer: "Typical implementations range from 2-6 weeks for pilots to 3-6 months for full production deployments, depending on scope and complexity."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you work with our existing infrastructure?",
    answer: "Yes. We design solutions that integrate with your existing tools, databases, and workflows. Our approach is infrastructure-agnostic and can deploy on-prem, private cloud, or hybrid environments."
  },
  {
    question: "What level of technical expertise do we need?",
    answer: "None required to get started. We handle the technical implementation and provide training for your team. Solutions are designed to be maintainable by your IT staff with our documentation and support."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you ensure data security and privacy?",
    answer: "All solutions are designed with security-first principles: on-prem or private cloud deployment, SSO/RBAC integration, audit trails, and compliance with GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2, and ISO 27001 standards."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens after deployment?",
    answer: "We provide comprehensive handover documentation, team training, and optional ongoing support. You own the solution, the models, and the data. We can offer monitoring and optimization services as needed."
  },
  {
    question: "Can we start with a small pilot project?",
    answer: "Absolutely. We recommend starting with a focused pilot (10-20 documents or a single workflow) to demonstrate value quickly. Successful pilots typically lead to broader rollouts."
