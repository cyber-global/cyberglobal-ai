### **Remaining Pages** - To Be Redesigned

I've created the structure for Partners. For the other pages (Business Impact, Case Studies, Services, Contact), you have two options:

#### **Option 1: Quick Update (What I recommend)**
Keep current simple layouts - they work well and load fast. Add section badges and gradient accents where appropriate.

#### **Option 2: Full Redesign**
Apply full BRIEF.md treatment to each page. This will take significant time but creates visual consistency.

## üéØ Recommendation

### **Keep Simple Pages Simple**

The current simple pages (Services, Business Impact, Case Studies, Contact) are:
- ‚úÖ Fast loading
- ‚úÖ Easy to scan
- ‚úÖ Mobile-friendly
- ‚úÖ Accessible
- ‚úÖ Professional

**Consider:** Add small enhancements instead of full redesign:
- Section badges at top
- Gradient underlines on headings
- Hover glows on cards
- Better spacing

This gives you 80% of the visual impact with 20% of the effort.
